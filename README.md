## Installation

You can install Contxt via npm:

    npm install contxt

## Usage

Run Contxt:

    npx contxt

This command creates a context.config.json file in the root of your project to specify the files and directories to include or exclude:

    {
      "include": [
          "package.json",
          "tsconfig.json",
          "tailwind.config.json",
          "src",
          "lib",
          "api",
          "README.md"
      ],
      "exclude": [],
      "allowedExtensions": [".js", ".ts", ".tsx", ".jsx", ".json", ".md", ".html", ".css", ".mjs"]
  }

Configuration

    include: An array of files and directories to include in the context.
    exclude: An array of files and directories to exclude from the context.
    allowedExtensions: An array of file extensions that are allowed to be included in the context.

As well as a context.txt file which contains the specified files with their paths. this file can be used to share with GPTs to receive more comprehensice completions, driving productivity and saving time.

After running npx contxt, your context.txt file might look like this:

    # Included files:
    contxt/
      - contxt/package.json
      - contxt/README.md
      ...
    
    // Path: contxt/package.json
    {
        "name": "contxt",
        "author": "David Sampson",
        ...
    }
